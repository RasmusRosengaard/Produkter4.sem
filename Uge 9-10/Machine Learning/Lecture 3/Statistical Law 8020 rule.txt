Statistical Law 80/20 Principle

The Pareto principle is a popular example of such a "law". 
It states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, and is thus also known as the 80/20 rule. 
In software engineering, it is often said that 80% of the errors are caused by just 20% of the bugs.
